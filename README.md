This dashboard visualizes traffic accidents occurring in the United States from 2016-2023. Using the dashboard, it is possible to visualize many aspects of the accidents, including weather, time, location, and severity.

The hosted version of the dashboard uses a subset of the full dataset, since the full version is too big to use; the full version can be found at the following Google cloud storage link:
https://storage.googleapis.com/ds4003-accident-data/data_final_3.csv

The original dataset is also too large to put in the repository; it can be found here:
