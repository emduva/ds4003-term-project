This dashboard visualizes traffic accidents occurring in the United States from 2016-2023. The intended use for this dashboard is to explore the factors that can lead to an accident occurring, and factors affecting the frequency of traffic accidents. These factors include location, time of day, weather, road features, and more.

The hosted version of the dashboard uses a subset of the full dataset, since the full version is too big to use; the full version can be found at the following Google cloud storage link:

The original dataset is also too large to put in the repository; it can be found here:
