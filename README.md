This dashboard visualizes traffic accidents occurring in the United States from 2016-2023. Using the dashboard, it is possible to visualize many aspects of the accidents, including weather, time, location, and severity.

The dataset for the dashboard is too big to keep in the repository; it is hosted at the following Google cloud storage link:
